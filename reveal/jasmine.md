# BDD

* based on TDD
* not change test flow, but how to write test
* another way to write Unit Test

encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project. 

  Writing test by scenarios
  
**Given** some initial context (the givens),
**When** an event occurs,
**then** ensure some outcomes.


## TDD

for each unit of software, a software developer must:


* define a test set for the unit first;
* then implement the unit;
* finally verify that the implementation of the unit makes the tests succeed.
