# Chapter 17: HOP Meets Chaos Engineering

### how can manufacturing industry learn from chaos engineering

<!-- Software are built by human -->

---
# HOP: Human and Organizational Performance

> an **approach** to improving **organizational structures** and **functional processes** to optimize for business-critical properties such as safty

- commonly applied in manufacturing
- _new view_ philosophy: build safer system

---

# Five principles

- guide to improving operational reliability and resilience in **general industry** (not only manufacturing)

---

# 1: Error Is Normal

- All humans make mistakes
- The people who make the most mistakes are those who do the most work
- Prevent the errors that we can, also build in the capacity to **fail safely**
  + e.g.: automotive manufacturers

<!-- 
prevent error: warning system, automated steering, brake assist
safe to fail: airbags, survivable space
-->
---

# 2: Blame Fixes Nothing

- blame drives information underground
- shift the way of thinking for accountability
  + stop focusing on blame, but on learning and improving
- we need to make deliberate effort to direct the orgrnization towards learning
  + humans are good at inferring connections between things

---

# 3: Context Drives Behavior

- systems and metrics surrounding work
- context often drives behavior that is disjointed from the goal of the business
- be **open** and **honest** about the behaviors those systems are driving
- keep refining and improving

---

# 4: Learning and Improving Is Vital

- what we learned should be effective and improve current work, not in theory
- effective testing or analysis of the improvments

---

# 5: Intentional Response Matters

- incident response: set the motion
  + it will lead us to better understanding and improving
  + not blame
- response throughout the organization, at all levels is important

---

# HOP learn from Chaos Engineering

- apply Chaos Engineering to manufacturing 
- Chaos Engineering: experimenting to learn something **new**, not to test against predefined conditions
- e.g.: simulation training rooms
  + add randomness error to the training, and test human real-time response

---

# Conclusion

- Chaos Engineering complements HOP
